Verse 1
I thought we had it all, our love was like a dream
But now I'm left with nothing, only memories it seems
I can't help but wonder, where did we go wrong?
Now I'm left here singing, a sad and lonely song

Chorus
Lost love, it's tearing me apart
My heart is heavy, and it's breaking my heart
Lost love, why did you have to go?
I'm left with nothing, but the pain that you bestowed

Verse 2
I see you in every face, in every single place
It's hard to move on, with our memories in my space
I thought we had forever, but forever's not enough
Now I'm left here singing, a song of lost love

Chorus
Lost love, it's tearing me apart
My heart is heavy, and it's breaking my heart
Lost love, why did you have to go?
I'm left with nothing, but the pain that you bestowed

Bridge
I wish that I could turn back time
And make things right,
And make you mine
But all I have are regrets
And a love that's lost
that I can't forget

Chorus
Lost love, it's tearing me apart
My heart is heavy, and it's breaking my heart
Lost love, why did you have to go?
I'm left with nothing, but the pain that you bestowed

Outro
Lost love, it's hard to say goodbye
But I'll keep on singing, until the day I die
Lost love, I'll always feel this way
But I'll keep on singing, until the end of my days.
