Verse 1
There once was a cat, so silly and strange
Who loved to play with yarn and things that change
He'd chase his own tail, and run up the walls
And knock over vases, and break porcelain dolls

Chorus
Oh, silly cat, what a life you lead
With your goofy antics, you're all that we need
You make us laugh, and you make us smile
Oh, silly cat, you're worth every mile

Verse 2
One day he got stuck, in a paper bag
And strutted around, with a confident swag
He meowed and he purred, with such great pride
His silly demeanor, we could never hide

Chorus
Oh, silly cat, what a life you lead
With your goofy antics, you're all that we need
You make us laugh, and you make us smile
Oh, silly cat, you're worth every mile

Bridge
He'd sleep in the sun, with such great grace
Watchin' the birds, with a look of distaste
But when he'd dream, he'd twitch and he'd purr
And we'd all agree, what a silly fur

Chorus
Oh, silly cat, what a life you lead
With your goofy antics, you're all we need
You make us laugh, and you make us smile
Oh, silly cat, you're worth every mile

Outro
So here's to our kitty, so funny and sly
With his playful spirit, he'll never die
He'll always be there, to brighten our days
Oh, silly cat, you're worth every praise.
