Verse 1:
Big cat, fat cat, lying on the mat
Eatin' all day, never wants to chat
Paws in the air, feeling like a king
Living the life without worrying.

Chorus:
Fat cat, living large
With a belly so round and a heart so large
Sleepin' all day
Eatin' all night
Fat cat, you're my delight.

Verse 2:
Big cat, fat cat, never in a rush
Smiling all day without making much fuss
Soft fur, big eyes, so cute and strong
In your world, everything seems so long.

Chorus:
Fat cat, living large
With a belly so round and a heart so large
Sleepin' all day
Eatin' all night
Fat cat, you're my delight.

Bridge:
Some may say you're too big, too slow
But I say you're perfect, and I know
You bring comfort, love, and grace
In this world, you have your place.

Chorus:
Fat cat, living large
With a belly so round and a heart so large
Sleepin' all day
Eatin' all night
Fat cat, you're my delight.

Outro:
Big cat, fat cat
You make my heart sing
In your presence, all my troubles take wing
You're my best friend, you're my confidant
Hey, Fat Cat, you are all that I want.
